# 1030-Final-Project
## Kobe Bryant Shot Selection
This project analysed the Kaggle playground challenge Kobe Bryant's shot selection. The data contained the location and circumstances of every field goal attempted by Kobe Bryant during his 20-year career. The task was to predict whether the basket went in (shot_made_flag). Kaggle had removed 5000 of the shot_made_flags (represented as missing values in the csv file). These were the test set shots for which one must submit a prediction.\
Please find "report/1030 Final Project.pdf" for the summary report of this analysis.
